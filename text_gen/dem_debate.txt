Q: Candidates, welcome. Vice President Biden, the first question is for you. In the last few days, you’ve been saying that Democrats will be taking too big a risk if they nominate Senator Sanders or Mayor Buttigieg, but they came out on top in Iowa. What risks did the Iowa Democrats miss? A: Oh, they didn’t miss anything. It’s a long race. I took a hit in Iowa and I’ll probably take a hit here. Traditionally Bernie won by 20 points last time. And usually it’s the neighboring senators that do well. But no matter what, I’m still in this for the same reason, we have to restore the soul of this country, bring back the middle class and make sure we bring people together. And so it’s a simple proposition. It doesn’t matter whether it’s this one or the next. I’ve always viewed the first four encounters, two primaries, and two caucuses as the starting point. And so that’s how I view it. Q: Why are Senator Sanders and Mayor Buttigieg too big a risk for Democrats? A: Well, you know that with regard to Senator Sanders, the President wants very much to sic a label on every candidate. We’re going to not only have to win this time, we have to bring along the United States Senate. And Bernie’s labeled himself, not me, a democratic socialist. I think that’s the label that the President’s going to lay on everyone running with Bernie if he’s a nominee. And a Mayor Buttigieg is a great guy and a real patriot. He’s a mayor of a small city, who has done some good things but has not demonstrated he has the ability to, and we’ll soon find out, to get a broad scope of support across the spectrum, including African Americans and Latinos.
